Welcome to Python 3.7's help utility!

If this is your first time using Python, you should definitely check out
the tutorial on the Internet at https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/.

Enter the name of any module, keyword, or topic to get help on writing
Python programs and using Python modules.  To quit this help utility and
return to the interpreter, just type "quit".

To get a list of available modules, keywords, symbols, or topics, type
"modules", "keywords", "symbols", or "topics".  Each module also comes
with a one-line summary of what it does; to list the modules whose name
or summary contain a given string such as "spam", type "modules spam".

help> "modules"

Please wait a moment while I gather a list of all available modules...

Use help(str) for help on the str class.

help> 

You are now leaving help and returning to the Python interpreter.
If you want to ask for help on a particular object directly from the
interpreter, you can type "help(object)".  Executing "help('string')"
has the same effect as typing a particular string at the help> prompt.
>>> 
>>> help(str)
Help on class str in module builtins:

class str(object)
 |  str(object='') -> str
 |  str(bytes_or_buffer[, encoding[, errors]]) -> str
 |  
 |  Create a new string object from the given object. If encoding or
 |  errors is specified, then the object must expose a data buffer
 |  that will be decoded using the given encoding and error handler.
 |  Otherwise, returns the result of object.__str__() (if defined)
 |  or repr(object).
 |  encoding defaults to sys.getdefaultencoding().
 |  errors defaults to 'strict'.
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __add__(self, value, /)
 |      Return self+value.
 |  
 |  __contains__(self, key, /)

 |      Return self==value.
 |  
 |  __format__(self, format_spec, /)
 |      Return a formatted version of the string as described by format_spec.
 |  
 |  __ge__(self, value, /)
 |      Return self>=value.
 |  
 |  __getattribute__(self, name, /)
 |      Return getattr(self, name).

 |      Return self[key].
 |  
 |  __getnewargs__(...)
 |  
 |  __gt__(self, value, /)
 |      Return self>value.
 |  
 |  __hash__(self, /)
 |      Return hash(self).
 |  
 |  __iter__(self, /)
 |      Implement iter(self).
 |  
 |  __le__(self, value, /)
 |      Return self<=value.
 |  
 |  __len__(self, /)
 |      Return len(self).
 |  
 |  __lt__(self, value, /)
 |      Return self<value.
 |  
 |  __mod__(self, value, /)
 |      Return self%value.
 |  
 |  __mul__(self, value, /)
 |      Return self*value.
 |  
 |  __ne__(self, value, /)
 |      Return self!=value.
 |  
 |  __repr__(self, /)
 |      Return repr(self).
 |  
 |  __rmod__(self, value, /)
 |      Return value%self.
 |  
 |  __rmul__(self, value, /)
 |      Return value*self.
 |  
 |  __sizeof__(self, /)
 |      Return the size of the string in memory, in bytes.
 |  
 |  __str__(self, /)
 |      Return str(self).
 |  
 |  capitalize(self, /)
 |      Return a capitalized version of the string.
 |      
 |      More specifically, make the first character have upper case and the rest lower
 |      case.
 |  
 |  casefold(self, /)
 |      Return a version of the string suitable for caseless comparisons.
 |  
 |  center(self, width, fillchar=' ', /)
 |      Return a centered string of length width.
 |      
 |      Padding is done using the specified fill character (default is a space).
 |  
 |  count(...)
 |      S.count(sub[, start[, end]]) -> int
 |      
 |      Return the number of non-overlapping occurrences of substring sub in
 |      string S[start:end].  Optional arguments start and end are
 |      interpreted as in slice notation.
 |  
 |  encode(self, /, encoding='utf-8', errors='strict')
 |      Encode the string using the codec registered for encoding.
 |      
 |      encoding
 |        The encoding in which to encode the string.
 |      errors
 |        The error handling scheme to use for encoding errors.
 |        The default is 'strict' meaning that encoding errors raise a
 |        UnicodeEncodeError.  Other possible values are 'ignore', 'replace' and
 |        'xmlcharrefreplace' as well as any other name registered with
 |        codecs.register_error that can handle UnicodeEncodeErrors.
 |  
 |  endswith(...)
 |      S.endswith(suffix[, start[, end]]) -> bool
 |      
 |      Return True if S ends with the specified suffix, False otherwise.
 |      With optional start, test S beginning at that position.
 |      With optional end, stop comparing S at that position.
 |      suffix can also be a tuple of strings to try.
 |  
 |  expandtabs(self, /, tabsize=8)
 |      Return a copy where all tab characters are expanded using spaces.
 |      
 |      If tabsize is not given, a tab size of 8 characters is assumed.
 |  
 |  find(...)
 |      S.find(sub[, start[, end]]) -> int
 |      
 |      Return the lowest index in S where substring sub is found,
 |      such that sub is contained within S[start:end].  Optional
 |      arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation.
 |      
 |      Return -1 on failure.
 |  
 |  format(...)
 |      S.format(*args, **kwargs) -> str
 |      
 |      Return a formatted version of S, using substitutions from args and kwargs.
 |      The substitutions are identified by braces ('{' and '}').
 |  
 |  format_map(...)
 |      S.format_map(mapping) -> str
 |      
 |      Return a formatted version of S, using substitutions from mapping.
 |      The substitutions are identified by braces ('{' and '}').
 |  
 |  index(...)
 |      S.index(sub[, start[, end]]) -> int
 |      
 |      Return the lowest index in S where substring sub is found, 
 |      such that sub is contained within S[start:end].  Optional
 |      arguments start and end are interpreted as in slice notation.
 |      
 |      Raises ValueError when the substring is not found.
 |  
 |  isalnum(self, /)
 |      Return True if the string is an alpha-numeric string, False otherwise.
 |      
 |      A string is alpha-numeric if all characters in the string are alpha-numeric and
 |      there is at least one character in the string.
 |  
 |  isalpha(self, /)
 |      Return True if the string is an alphabetic string, False otherwise.
 |      
 |      A string is alphabetic if all characters in the string are alphabetic and there
 |      is at least one character in the string.
 |  
 |  isascii(self, /)
 |      Return True if all characters in the string are ASCII, False otherwise.
 |      
 |      ASCII characters have code points in the range U+0000-U+007F.
 |      Empty string is ASCII too.
 |

 |  Static methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __new__(*args, **kwargs) from builtins.type
 |      Create and return a new object.  See help(type) for accurate signature.

 |      in the resulting dictionary, each character in x will be mapped to the
 |      character at the same position in y. If there is a third argument, it
 |      must be a string, whose characters will be mapped to None in the result.

 |      cased characters have lower case.
 |  
 |  translate(self, table, /)
 |      Replace each character in the string using the given translation table.
 |      
 |        table
 |          Translation table, which must be a mapping of Unicode ordinals to
 |          Unicode ordinals, strings, or None.
 |      
 |      The table must implement lookup/indexing via __getitem__, for instance a
 |      dictionary or list.  If this operation raises LookupError, the character is
 |      left untouched.  Characters mapped to None are deleted.
 |  
 |  upper(self, /)
 |      Return a copy of the string converted to uppercase.
 |  
 |  zfill(self, width, /)
 |      Pad a numeric string with zeros on the left, to fill a field of the given width.
 |      
 |      The string is never truncated.
 |  
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Static methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __new__(*args, **kwargs) from builtins.type
 |      Create and return a new object.  See help(type) for accurate signature.
 |  
 |  maketrans(x, y=None, z=None, /)
 |      Return a translation table usable for str.translate().
 |      
 |      If there is only one argument, it must be a dictionary mapping Unicode
 |      ordinals (integers) or characters to Unicode ordinals, strings or None.
 |      Character keys will be then converted to ordinals.
 |      If there are two arguments, they must be strings of equal length, and
 |      in the resulting dictionary, each character in x will be mapped to the
 |      character at the same position in y. If there is a third argument, it
 |      must be a string, whose characters will be mapped to None in the result.

Welcome to Python 3.7's help utility!

If this is your first time using Python, you should definitely check out
the tutorial on the Internet at https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/.

Enter the name of any module, keyword, or topic to get help on writing
Python programs and using Python modules.  To quit this help utility and
return to the interpreter, just type "quit".

To get a list of available modules, keywords, symbols, or topics, type
"modules", "keywords", "symbols", or "topics".  Each module also comes
with a one-line summary of what it does; to list the modules whose name
or summary contain a given string such as "spam", type "modules spam".
